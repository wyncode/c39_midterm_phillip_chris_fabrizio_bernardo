Get your favorite NBA player's stats in one simple location. The app will search for player stats from 2015-2019 nba season.

## Setup

## Available build commands

- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your local React app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
